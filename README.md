# Simple-Clock_Display-Script
This script will create a simple GUI window with a label that displays the current time. The time will be updated once per second.
Here is a simple script that will display a clock using the time module in Python. 
Note that this script will only work properly if it is run on a system with a functioning time zone and clock.
